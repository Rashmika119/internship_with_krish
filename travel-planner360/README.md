Rollout Plan --API Version Migration (V1 -->V2)
-----------------------------------------------

🌟 Stratergy: Canary Deployement

📌Deploy version 1 and version 2 side by side 

📌Gradual traffic shifting to v2

📌When v2 reaches 95% traffic, v1 will be removed

📌Shutdown date for v1: 2025-12-30

🌟Rollout Phases

💡 Phase 1 -Parallel Deployemnet 

📌Deploy version 1 and version 2 side by side

📌Expose V2 endpoints for new consumers

📌No impact on existing consumers.So zero distruption for v1 consumers

📌Documentation updated to show v2 availability

💡 Phase 2 - Traffic Monitoring and Canary start

📌Here test the v2 in production with real traffic.

📌Beging routing a small trffic to v2 (5-10%)

📌Select a specific user group (ex:like premium users)

📌Then can give X header for them (ex:X-API-Version: 2)

📌First we can redirect them to version 2 and give them the response in version 1 structure

📌when 60% of them reach them give default values for the consumers that use version1 📌although now to adapt them for version 2 response structure

📌Key Monitoring:

- Error rate
- Latency
- Weather service failure
- Response consistency
  
📌Rollback to v1 immediately to va if an instability occurs

💡 Phase 3 - Gradually trffic shift

📌Traffic increases in steps

Rollout Step	    % to v2	        % to v1
Start	            5–10%	          90–95%
Step 2	          25%	            75%
Step 3	          50%	            50%
Step 4	          75%	            25%

📌Continue monitoring failures and performance

💡 Phase 4 – Make v2 Default (95% Traffic)

📌v2 handles almost all requests

📌All new integrations use v2 only

📌v1 remains for legacy consumers

📌Deprecation warning period begins

- Example deprecation header:

Deprecation: true
Sunset: 2025-12-30
Use: /v2/trips/search

💡 Phase 5 – Sunset & Retirement of v1

📌Triggered when:

- v2 reaches 95% adoption
- Most consumers migrated
  
📌v1 shutdown date: 2025-12-30

📌After shutdown, v1 endpoints may return:

- 410 Gone OR
- 404 Not Found
  
📌No protocol-level redirect or request transformation
